                Canadian term is "free expression" and the library term
                is "intellectual freedom"?</li>

                prescribed in the Canadian Charter of Rights?</li>

          </section>

          <section>
            <ul><li>Principle of equality: universal distribution of
                equal rights.</li>
                  <li>Difference principle: A departure from strict
                    equality is only justified if a) inequalities are
                    attached to positions open to all and b) the conditions of the
                    worst
                    off are improved.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section><p style="font-size:18pt;text-align:left">Canadian
            Charter allows for the application of the difference
            principle. The CFLA intellectual freedom statement inherits
            the difference principle from the Charter (but not from the
            UN Declaration). If Vickery Bowles wanted an *absolutist*
            stance on intellectual freedom, she needed a constitutional
            context which did *not* provide for the difference
            principle: the First Amendment. Hence the adoption of "free
            speech".</section>

          <section><p style="font-size:18pt;text-align:left">The CFLA
            Statement on Intellectual Freedom inherits the principle of
            difference from one source, but not from the other. This
            inherits an ambiguity into the CFLA statement which likely
            makes it amenable to any position. Not great for a policy
            document. Again, this is why Vickery Bowles couldn't rely on
            it.</section>


          <section><p style="font-size:18pt;text-align:left">Liberalism,
            in both its Canadian and American variants, comes from the
            same sources as John Rawls' theory of justice. As a result
            an ambiguity - over the primacy of one or other of the
            principles of justice - is baked into the Charter of Rights
            and Freedom and the Bill of Rights. This makes both
            documents subject to opportunistic interpretations. (Hence
            institutions like the Supreme Court).</section>
